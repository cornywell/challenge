"1698828226","Kleveland","2020-12-04","4.0","Activiy Tracking ""different"" than Fitbit","As a follow-up to a previous review I submitted, I have comments/opinions about the Apple activity tracking features:I have had the Apple watch for 7 weeks:Active minutes on my Apple Watch SE are very different from my Fitbit tracking of minutes.  While my Fitbit does not automatically accumulate minutes until you exceed 10 minutes of continuous activity, the Apple watch will count minutes differently in that it counts minutes from the start of an exercise whether you activate a exercise option (such as indoor walk, outdoor walk, etc.) or not.  This is a nice feature although I find the minute counts on the Apple watch do not mirror the actual time you do the exercise.  For example, I did a brisk indoor walk for 20 elapsed minutes today and the Apple watch only showed 10 active minutes while the Fitbit watch showed the full twenty minutes.  I wear both watches at the same time (on different wrists) and find that overall the Apple watch will show about 40% fewer minutes per day as compared to the Fitbit watch.  I typically average 100-120 minutes per day on the Fitbit watch but only around 70 - 80 minutes on the Apple watch.In summary, the Fitbit watch (I have a Charge 2) counts all the minutes for exercise events lasting 10 minutes or more; the Apple watch counts fewer minutes.  This may have something to do with heart rate zones effecting the minute count on the Apple watch.  I prefer the Fitbit watch's calculations for exercise minute counts because they reflex the real time I exercised.Otherwise, the Apple watch is a great watch and has many nice features.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2TTMIROQS8VOR","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX460_.png","","true","en","","R2TTMIROQS8VOR","","https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5ZRFRG/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=apple watch&qid=1607388738&refinements=p_89:Apple&rnid=2528832011&s=wearable-tech&sr=1-1"

There are some features from the Apple Watch 6 that the SE misses out on (""Always On"", processor speed, a mode of heart monitoring, etc.), but weighed against the additional investment required, I certainly don't miss them.

"1698829907","Zach Davidson","2020-11-23","5.0","Buy THIS, NOT the series 6","From my research (do your own obviously), the only real differences between this and the series 6 are the blood o2 sensor, the always on display, and the larger battery (to compensate for the extra sensor and the always on display). I thought always on would be important to me but when your watch becomes part of your phone you’re much more concerned with battery life (which is great on this btw, lasts all day, if not a day and a half). Plus, if you’re not looking at the watch who cares if the display is on? Unless you have a medical reason get this over the series 6 100%. Also, if you consider yourself anything more than a basic iPhone user GET AN APPLE WATCH! It’ll save you so much phone battery and make so many things so much easier.

"1698829909","Vada","2020-11-23","5.0","LOVE my new watch!!","This is my first Apple Watch. I bought it mainly for the Dexcom CGM (continuous glucose monitor) complication and being able to have my blood sugar reading on my watch at all times. So far it works perfectly for that. I was able to get it figured out and within a few minutes of first putting on the watch I had my blood sugar reading on there. It’s really an amazing technology option for diabetics with a CGM.I got the 44mm, partly because the color I wanted was in stock and I’d receive it quicker. I was afraid it would be too big. I’m an adult woman and have pretty small wrists. The Apple Watch comes with two band options. One labeled small and one medium/large. The small is perfect. I have it on the second smallest hole and I love the size of the watch and how it fits.Overall I love my new Apple Watch. The packaging is great and everything you would expect from Apple. It was really easy to set up and start using. Charging is easy and it comes with the charger. I already set up a sleep app to monitor my sleep. I love the fitness options and monitoring activity. I’m really looking forward to discovering new functionality and the watch is already having a super positive impact on my health and wellness. I think the price point is great and it’s definitely worth it!!

First off, the watch band didn’t lock - a fault in the spring mechanism. Then, whenever I wanted to wake up the watch by flicking my wrist; it wouldn’t wake up unless I did it with a good bit of effort. This felt like a downgrade since I’ve had cheaper android watches that wake up without much effort. I returned it, planning on getting the series 5 on sales instead.

It runs so much faster, is thinner and lighter and the display feels bigger than just the 2 mm. I didn't need the EKG tech and do not want independent service on this device, the GPS & bluetooth is perfectly fine.

Boy was I wrong. I move around quite a lot and lift and move many things. After the first week I noticed a minor scrape/scuff on the bottom of the watch. I was disappointed, but thought I was just unlucky and it happened when I was carrying groceries in my house and accidentally let the door close and used my watch hand to stop it. Either way, it wasn’t that aggressive of a move and I assumed the watch was built stronger. Just last night I noticed a crack in the screen and the bottom where the scuff was, it was actually chipping pieces of glass off when touched.TL:DR GET APPLE CARE!! Especially if you plan on wearing this through your daily activities and not just exercise. The screen WILL take damage easily. I should’ve known better after owning IPhones for years.

"1698831593","S K","2020-11-17","5.0","Thrilled with this watch!","I like gadgets, so I'm surprised I hadn't jumped onto the smartwatch bandwagon already.  I think I was reluctant to pay a lot to tell the time when I already had a watch - that told me the date too!  But, come Amazon Prime day, I decided to dish out $30 bucks on a low end smart watch.  And I loved it!  It could count my steps, set an alarm, set a timer, and had a relaxation/meditation app!  Much more than just a watch...So it began.  I started looking into a proper smart watch and asked around amongst my friends.  I did my research on all the different Apple Watch series and face sizes.  To summarize, Apple only sells series 3 (gps only), SE, and series 6.  Series 4 and 5 are being discontinued but can still be found here and there to buy.SE seems to be the best compromise on cost and value.  It has the bigger screen size, louder mic, and more space than the series 3, but doesn't have the blood oxygen, ECG, or always-on screen like the series 6.  I can live without those perks to save over $100.  The new SE also has a lower price than series 5.I had bought the 44m at first, thinking I don't have dainty skinny wrists and I'd probably appreciate the bigger screen in the long run.  But the 44mm was just a bit TOO big for my liking, so I got the 40mm instead, which is perfect for me.  It really is a personal preference, but the smaller screen is still perfectly clear enough for me.Set up was easy peasy and I love the additional functions on this watch.  I can control Audible from my watch instead of shouting at Siri while I'm driving, I can check the time and weather across the globe from my wrist, I can check emails and texts at a glance without having to dig out my phone, I can add expenses to my tracker app using my watch, and I can record voice memos on the go!  I love it!  I haven't even used the Apple pay feature yet.  And yes, it does everything that my other cheap smart watch does too.For me, it wasn't worth paying extra for the cellular option as I tend to always have my phone nearby, so I don't need to pay for an extra data plan.  The only major bummer about this watch is that the battery power isn't great.  I usually hardly ever remove my regular watches from my wrist.  Even my cheapo smart watch lasted two weeks on one charge.  With this one, it needs to be charged pretty much daily, or every other day if you're lucky.  I've already bought a portable smart watch charger that can charge directly from USB, I keep it in my handbag.  I think this battery issue is the same for all Apple Watches so I'm ok with accepting there's no way around it.I've also bought a third party metal band and a clear plastic cover with screen protector.  I'd be heartbroken if I managed to scratch this watch anytime soon, but I might be less precious about it after a few months!  Very happy with my purchase and I look forward to making good use of it!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3T5NIOF6GL0HT","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX460_.png","","true","en","","R3T5NIOF6GL0HT","","https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5ZRFRG/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=apple watch&qid=1607388738&refinements=p_89:Apple&rnid=2528832011&s=wearable-tech&sr=1-1"

So glad I did, I already have an Apple Watch SE this one was a early Christmas 🎁 gift and it’s perfect. It was delivered in one day with my Prime and in the original Apple Box of course. So if you are worried this is a knock off don’t be it’s the REAL DEAL Apple Watch SE 44 mm. It was packed in a larger Amazon Box and was delivered perfectly and as expected! Turned on and works perfectly too. My friend is very happy with it and has already had it on for two days now. Everything is in proper working order and it paired perfectly and quickly with her IPhone 11. It did need to update but that’s how all Apple Watches are when you first take them out of the box. I have had another one as well so I know. There is a ton of gigs on this watch too. Lots of room to have all your apps and keep in the know. I can’t say enough good and positive things about this purchase. The watch comes with a band that has the smaller fitting size as well as the larger fitting size band in the box, so it will work with anyone’s wrist too. We purchased the GPS since we didn’t need cellular service but that is an option if you need it. Bluetooth pairing is the best and your iPhone won’t forget the watch once it is paired. But you do have to have an iPhone for this Apple Watch SE to be able to pair with. Just so you know. It’s a beautiful watch just as pictured in the store. You can also purchase the Apple Care right from Amazon if you want to. We didn’t though, still it is an option when you check out. Don’t forget to download the Watch OS app to your iPhone before you pair it. It’s a simple app to navigate for even first timers. I definitely recommend this purchase for yourself or as a gift like I did. Hope I’ve helped somebody out with this review.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R37VP4YCNYCMEU","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/5de1a37f-3791-4cd0-ae0a-9a8b485e940b._CR0,0,375,375_SX460_.jpg","","true","en","","R37VP4YCNYCMEU","","https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5ZRFRG/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=apple watch&qid=1607388738&refinements=p_89:Apple&rnid=2528832011&s=wearable-tech&sr=1-1"

"1698834010","Liv","2020-10-21","3.0","Watch would not turn on after 1 nights charge","After smashing the screen of my 6 month old Apple Watch 5 and downloading an update that left the watch useless, I decided I had to replace the darn thing. The SE is so enticing with its low(er) price point and all the basic features I wanted. Rather than forking over $200 to replace a cracked screen, I decided to go ahead and buy a completely new watch.I received the watch yesterday with Amazon Prime’s fantastic delivery service. The packing came as expected, in perfect condition. I turned the watch on and went through the set up process only having a minor heart attack when it wouldn’t turn back on after updating. The watch was ready for use within 30 minutes and I couldn’t have been happier. I wore the watch for the remainder of the day with no issues and even did a workout! Man did I miss that little thing. At the end of the day it was time for us to go to sleep so I set it on the charger bed and turned the lights out.The next day I couldn’t wait to put it on and track my activity but to my dismay, it wouldn’t turn on. Nothing worked. It was properly sitting on the charger all night so there was just no excuse for the battery to be dead already. I attempted pressing the power button, pressing the power button and crown, setting it on the charger, and even tapping on the screen several times hoping it would magically wake up. I reached out to Apple support and they also did not have any new solutions for me. My Apple Watch, less than 24 hours in my possession, is now, what I presume to be, dead.What’s odd is that even though the screen did not turn on my phone could still detect the battery percentage, which was dropping at a rapid rate, about 10% every couple minutes. I just cannot understand what I did wrong! When things go wrong with my tech where else do I turn to other than the one and only Twitter.Reliable sources (Reddit) say there have been 9 reported cases of 40 mm Apple Watch SE users in South Korea experiencing burns from their Apple watches and a splotch developing on the upper right hand corner of the screen. These descriptions seemed to fit my situation, at least it’s the closest I could find. Although I did not get burned, the watch was pretty hot when I took it off the charger and there is some slight discoloration in the corner by the crown.Now I love the Apple Watch. Had this device decided to work I would’ve probably not rated it at all because of course it deserves 5 stars. I actually give it 3 stars because of the delivery person being awesome and my positive experience with its predecessor. So I warn you all before purchasing this SE, maybe wait a little bit. Wait a little to see if these issues resolve or end up in a recall. It’ll save you a trip to UPS to return like I’ll be doing this weekend.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RDMZAHG6XVMH1","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/89e2590e-0437-4c2d-a48b-dd3b6af0f46f._CR0,0,500,500_SX460_.jpg","","true","en","","RDMZAHG6XVMH1","","https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5ZRFRG/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=apple watch&qid=1607388738&refinements=p_89:Apple&rnid=2528832011&s=wearable-tech&sr=1-1"

I’ve had a series 3 before, have played around with a series 6, and the SE is the best bang for your buck hands down.The series 3, even the 38mm one, looks and feels a bit bulky and doesn’t have as many features as this one. The series 6 has a few more features (literally like 3 or 4 that most people don’t even use or notice), but for the average person who wants an Apple Watch for working out and convenience, this is perfect.

This was a gift from someone who ordered it on Amazon from this listing and they got me the space gray 40mm gps version. I did a side by side comparison to my series 3 & the screen is ever so slightly bigger. I had issues with the touch screen capabilities after putting cases on it where as with my series 3 the touch screen worked fine with or without a case. I just adjusted the touch settings under accessibility & I can use it normally with the protective case covering the screen so it doesn’t crack (that fix ain’t cheap). I do still recommend it & I love the new added features plus it’s quite faster than my series 3 which is to be expected. I can use all of my old watch bands & don’t need to buy new ones which is 👍🏽.
